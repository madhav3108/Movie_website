<!--                                MOVIE WEBSITE                                    -->

# PACKAGES USED IN THIS MOVIE WESITE

#  1  <!--        Routing:          -->
Routing is allows users to navigate between different pages or views without requiring a full page reload. With the help of Routing,we can navigate  various sections of the movie website, such as <!--home ,TV Shows , BollyWood Movies , Login,Logout page and many more.--> 

We can access specific movie pages by clicking on links or using the browser's back and forward buttons and implement smooth and seamless navigation, providing a better user experience.

# 2    <!--        Axios:           -->
Axios enables communication with external APIs, such as The Movie Database (TMDB). You can use Axios to fetch movie information, retrieve images,  and other related data from the TMDB API. By making asynchronous HTTP requests with Axios, you can dynamically load movie details a

# 3     <!--       React Icons:     -->
Icons will enhance user experience of your movie website. Movie-themed icons into your components. For instance, you can use icons for play buttons, logout buttons and more. We can provide intuitive visual cues to users and make your movie website more engaging.

# 4     <!--       React Redux:     -->

# It is a State Management tool.
With the help of Redux we manage the application data flow. As a movie website can have lots of activities and multiple components . React Redux helps centralize the state in a store. Redux makes it easier to maintain and debug the application while ensuring consistent and efficient.


# 5     <!--       Firebase:         -->
Firebase in a movie website used to handling user authentication and data storage. Like in our website we  can use Firebase Authentication to allow users to sign in and create accounts on your movie website. I use firebase in this application .
<!-- 
    src -> utils -> firebase-config.js
        apiKey:ENTER_YOUR_API_KEY, 
        authDomain:ENTER_YOUR_API_KEY,
        projectId:ENTER_YOUR_API_KEY,
        storageBucket:ENTER_YOUR_API_KEY, 
        messagingSenderId:ENTER_YOUR_API_KEY, 
        appId:ENTER_YOUR_API_KEY,
        measurementId:ENTER_YOUR_API_KEY
-->

# 6     <!--       TMDB:            -->
TMDB is data source for your movie website. It offers comprehensive movie information, including movie details, cast and crew data, ratings, reviews, and more. By utilizing the TMDB API, you can fetch movie data and display it on your website. This allows you to provide users with an extensive catalog of movies and explore movies easily.

<!-- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
